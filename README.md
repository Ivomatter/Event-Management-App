# Event-Management-App
 A group project that I collaborated on along with a couple of other colleagues during a 2-week workshop at Nemetschek called Speed IT Up University Edition. This is a web app using ASP.NET MVC which allows for a simple event management system - administratiors can organize, create and edit events, and users (employees) can enroll for said events if they wish to.  My contribution to the project is working as a pair in pair programming with a colleague to cooperatively work on the events section of the program - we added the events tab, allowed for creation, editing and viewing details of events, as well as the necessary validations when creating a new event. All created events are viewed in a list, sorted alphabetically, from which users can view extra details and enroll for them. Employees can see who else is enrolled for a given event, meaning that they can see if their friends at the company are going to an event and help them decide. We also added an archive of past events that is viewable only to the administrator for exporting past event data.  Furthermore, a personal contribution of mine to the project was adding profile picture display under users' own profile pages, as well as in their own details tab, which only administrators can access for view and exportion of data.
